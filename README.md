# Python-kjv-psalms-lxx
PyPsalter
This Python script prints the today's readings from the LXX Psalter according to the Orthodox Christian tradition.

During the day, it will print the readings for Matins, and during the evening and night time, it will print the readings for Vespers.

Scripture is not my own translation, but was taken from catacomb.xyz's LXX correction of the King James Version. https://github.com/catacomb-xyz/kjv-psalms-lxx
